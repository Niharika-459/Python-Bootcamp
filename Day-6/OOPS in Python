object-->instance of class
class-->blue print of objects
constructors-->creates memory for the variables
class variable-->declared inside class instance variable-->declared inside method
Data abstraction-->hides the unecessary information,not required to the user -->Top level
abstraction is acheived by access specifier,abc module and abstract method
Encapsulation-->binding into single unit
Polymorphism-->behaving in different types based on situation
Inheritance-deriving sub class from parent class
Access specifiers-giving access or permission to access the data
1.Private-->in java default--within the class
2.Public-->accessed by all
3.Protected-->limited access
In python polymorphism can be acheivedby method overloading(compile tile)
,method overriding(runtime),operator overloading
self-->takes care of passing of the inputs and for iterating the inputs we use self
variable length argument-->takes care for the changing length of variable
Exception handling-->try,catch,throw
1.TRY-the statements which will raise an exception are written
2.FINALLY-execute at any cost--java
3.THROW,THROWS-exceptions
